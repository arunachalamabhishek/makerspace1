	<h1>Design & Innovation Fellowship

</h1>
</header>

<p>
Many students are coming forward to stay with the institute beyond their graduation to take their ideas beyond proof of concept. To promote this further IIT Delhi has introduced pre-incubation fellowships for students who would like to continue beyond their graduation up to 12 months for working towards translational research and/or commercialization of their innovations/products. Following students were in residence during 2016-17.
1. Varsha Kumari (Biochemical Engineering & Biotechnology) – Working on process innovation to produce 6 pentyl-α-pyrone (6pp) from renewable sources such as ligno-cellulosic waste. (supported by DIC)
2. Mohammad Asif (Applied Mechanics) – Successfully developed helmet strap tightening mechanism. (Supported by DIC)
3. Pulkit Sapra (Mechanical Engineering) – Working on development of refreshable Braille display device for visually challenged (Supported by Wellcome Trust)
4. Surabhi Yadav (Biochemical engineering & Biotechnology) – Working on development of models of inclusive innovation (Supported by Omidyar Foundation).
5. Mayank Aamseek (Mechanical Engineering) – Worked towards development of tactile books for visually challenged (Supported by MeitY)
