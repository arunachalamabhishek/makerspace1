<p>Embedded Systems Design is a multi-disciplinary course in which students working in small groups of 4-6 work towards a social need. They are expected to deliver in one semester an innovative solution for problems and challenges that are typical to India and perhaps other developing countries. The themes addressed as a part of this course include Assistive Technology, Smart Campus, Green Technologies etc.
Some salient projects of the year 2016 include:
1. An Innovative queue management system for government hospitals

4. An automated warning system for traffic violators
5. A smart board for notices, events and news

7. Making restaurant menus accessible to visually challenged
8. Supply and demand management system for vegetable vendors
