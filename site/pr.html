	<h1>Product Realisation</h1>
</header>

<p>Product Realization is an experiential learning course offered to all 850+ undergraduate students in their first year of engineering. The purpose of this course is to:
1. provide product building experience to students very early in their programmes.
2. provide hands-on experience of building a product in teams to address a need.
3. provide experiential learning opportunity so that students can relate their own experience to theoretical concepts.
4. build confidence among students to take up product design and innovation projects on their own in future academic sessions.
During the first half of this course, students familiarize themselves with various prototyping methods, manufacturing machines, tools and processes. During second half of the course, students build a simple product in teams to address a social need.
