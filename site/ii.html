	<h1>Inclusive Innovation</h1>
</header>

<p>The course exposes to students, inclusive innovation as:

1. Efforts targeted towards use of technology to meet the needs of people at the bottom of pyramid.
2.Innovations where value created accrues primarily to the society as a whole rather than private individuals & organizations.
3. Addressing needs which are essential but are not market driven, and
4. Innovations in processes and business models with a dual goal of financial sustainability and social impact.
Case studies based on successful social enterprises form an important part of this course. A major component of the course is a project which is carried out in multi-disciplinary teams of 3 to 4 students.

Some representative projects undertaken by student teams are given below:
1. Making traditional textile manufacturing processes less tedious.
2. Development of product service system (PSS) for small farmers to access agriculture machinery and equipment.
3. Modular reconfigurable portable shelters for construction workers and for homeless.
4. Storage and refrigeration options for vegetable and fruit street vendors.
5. Making Science/Maths learning fun for underprivileged children.
