</header>

<p>This experiential learning course introduces tools and methodologies for design and manufacture of products. The focus of this course covers various aspects of product design including need identification, development and evaluation of multiple solutions and concepts, manufacturability assessments, product costing, bill of materials, process planning for components & assembly and prototyping & testing. Unlike traditional design courses, this course considers all product life-cycle issues to design a product for a given need. All three aspects of product realization namely desirability, feasibility and viability are emphasized. During the process of product realization students also understand relation among design, materials and manufacturing.
