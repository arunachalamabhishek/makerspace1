	<h1>Short-term Prototyping Workshops</h1>
</header>

<p>To excite students in product building activities, institute under the aegis of DIC organized number of prototyping workshops in different thematic areas. As part of these workshops students go through ideation, conceptualization, design and prototyping. This give students opportunity to work with various hand tools, bench tools, powered tools and digital prototyping machining to deliver proof-of-concept prototypes and functional prototypes.

Students learn to select and use various engineering materials, explore different shapes, geometries and finishes to prototype their models. As the process of design and development is highly non-linear every student team explores multiple alternatives before choosing their own unique path to deliver results. Students are encouraged to interact with experts both within and outside campus and often exhibit their prototypes for general public. These workshops have helped to understand close relation among design, technology, art and prototyping.
